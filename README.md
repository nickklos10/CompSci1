# Storing strings in a linked list

This C program demonstrates the creation, manipulation, and deletion of a linked list to store and process characters, forming strings. The program reads a series of characters from an input file, inserts them into a linked list, converts the linked list back to a string, and then cleans up the memory used by the linked list.
The main function reads character sequences from an input file, uses these characters to build a linked list, converts the list back to a string, and then deallocates the list. This process is repeated for a specified number of inputs.
